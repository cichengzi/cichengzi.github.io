abstract: Advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) is one of the most anticipated emerging technologies in the automotive industry. With its hybrid properties related to vehicular structures and control systems, safety guarantees are crucial in promoting the development of autonomous vehicles. While ADAS involves various function switches, sudden changes of different control strategies may lead vehicles to lose stability and safety in extreme situations. Therefore, verifying ADAS functions with adaptive cruise control (ACC) is necessary, where ACC is a main function in ADAS. This paper proposes an approach for safety control based on hybrid automata and deep reinforcement learning. First, hybrid automata are built to describe ADAS functions, and then a deep reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize the strategies of ACC. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively manipulates vehicle maneuvers across four different scenarios, including acceleration, deceleration, emergency braking and vehicle cut-in. Furthermore, this approach shows strong interpretability, high efficiency, and low resource cost, with an inference requiring 1.08ms and 456.89MB of memory on the CPU.
