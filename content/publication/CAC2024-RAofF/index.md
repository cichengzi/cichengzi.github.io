abstract: The production process of catalytic cracking units involves many hazardous factors, presenting significant fire and explosion risks. Considering the complexity and high-risk nature of catalytic cracking units, this paper proposes a quantitative risk assessment algorithm based on a safety knowledge graph. First, the HAZOP analysis method is used to conduct a standardized analysis of the unit. Then, system process knowledge and analysis results are integrated to construct a safety knowledge graph. Based on this graph, evaluation rules for the risk priority algorithm are supplemented, and a risk assessment function is designed to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of node risk assessment, achieving quantitative risk evaluation for nodes.
