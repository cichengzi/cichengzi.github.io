abstract: The regeneration process of catalytic cracking reaction is a highly coupled and complex industrial control process, and local anomalies can cascade and propagate, leading to serious consequences. Aiming at this characteristic, this paper proposes a method to monitor the anomalies of the reaction regeneration process and identify the root causes of the anomalies. First, a diagonal state space autoencoder (DS2AE) is used to monitor the process variables of the reaction regeneration process and identify the abnormal conditions and abnormal variables. Then, a causal analysis method (MIC-TDTE) based on maximum mutual information coefficient (MIC) and time delay transfer entropy (TDTE) is used to construct a causal model between the variables, where MIC calculates the correlation between the abnormal variables and TDTE explores the causality between the relevant variables. Finally, the causal diagram is used to traverse the propagation path of the anomalies in order to identify the root causes of the anomalies. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to the anomalous working condition dataset constructed by the FCC process simulation system.
