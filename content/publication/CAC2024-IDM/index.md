abstract: Process industry safety is critical to modern industrial manufacturing. However, the tight coupling between cyber and physical spaces raises significant challenges for system situation awareness and analysis, especially in light of the dual threat of cyberattacks and failures. In this study, an integrated digital model (IDM) construction and application methodology was proposed to enhance explainable system situational awareness and analysis capability. With advanced knowledge graph techniques, the method of IDM construction was provided, fusing the systemâ€™s real-time state with safety and security expertise. In addition, a multi-level system awareness and analysis pipeline based on the IDM was presented. It simultaneously considers temporal and spatial characteristics and domain expertise to realize the system status analysis at the point, path, and system level. Experimental studies show that the integrated digital model effectively improves intelligence situation awareness and analysis in the real fluid catalytic cracking system.
