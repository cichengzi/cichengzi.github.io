abstract = {Intelligent industrial manufacturing heavily relies on structured knowledge. Named Entity Recognition (NER), an essential technique for extracting structured knowledge from text, has garnered significant research interest. However, current NER approaches face difficulties in handling multiple levels of entity nesting in knowledge extraction, especially within the manufacturing context. To address this issue, we present an Anchor Span-based NER (ASNER) approach for accurately and efficiently extracting manufacturing text knowledge. This method combines token and span classification. Initially, the head and tail features of the entity are extracted, with the corresponding anchor span of potential entities generated based on a boundary match neural network to localize the entities. Subsequently, token spatial contextual features are extracted using biaffine attention and convolutional neural networks, and classification categories are assigned to the anchor span-filtered entity features. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASNER approach.}
